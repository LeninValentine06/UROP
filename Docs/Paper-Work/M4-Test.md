Performance Metrics for RTOS-Based M4 Single-Core System
1. Real-Time Performance Metrics
1.1 End-to-End Latency

Definition: Time from sensor data acquisition to final computed output availability.

Metric	M4 Single-Core RTOS
Average latency (ms)	0.0097
Maximum latency (ms)	1.0
1.2 Worst Case Execution Time (WCET)

Definition: Maximum observed execution time of the critical task chain under worst-case conditions.

System	WCET (ms)	WCET (Clock Cycles)
M4 Single-Core RTOS	< 1 ms (tick-limited)	< 84,000 cycles

Note: WCET is bounded by the 1 ms RTOS tick; tasks complete within a single tick.

1.3 Deadline Miss Rate

Definition: Percentage of task instances that miss their deadlines.

System	Total Samples	Missed Deadlines	Miss Rate (%)
M4 Single-Core RTOS	1547	0	0.0%
2. Scheduling and Timing Metrics
2.1 Jitter

Definition: Variation in task start time relative to its expected periodic schedule.

Metric	M4 Single-Core RTOS (ms)
Average jitter	10.0
Maximum jitter	10.0

Measured at RTOS tick granularity (1 ms).

2.2 Task Response Time

Definition: Time from task release (interrupt/event) to task completion.

Task	M4 Single-Core RTOS (ms)	Clock Cycles (M4)
Signal Processing Task	0	< 84,000
Integration Task	0	< 84,000
Parameter Computation Task	0	< 84,000

Zero-millisecond values indicate completion within the same RTOS tick.

2.3 Context Switch Rate

Definition: Number of context switches per second, indicating scheduling overhead.

System	Context Switches / Second	Avg Cycles / Switch
M4 Single-Core RTOS	Not instrumented	—
3. CPU Utilization and Efficiency
3.1 CPU Utilization

Definition: Percentage of CPU time spent executing non-idle tasks.

CPU / Core	M4 Single-Core RTOS (%)
Core 0	Invalid (counter mismatch)
3.2 Idle Time Percentage

Definition: Percentage of time CPU remains idle (low-power or idle task).

System	Idle Time (%)	Idle Cycles (%)
M4 Single-Core RTOS	Invalid (division by zero)	—

Idle hook active; total-tick counter not synchronized.

4. Memory Usage and Safety Metrics
4.1 Total SRAM Footprint

Definition: Breakdown of SRAM usage across RTOS components.

Memory Component	M4 Single-Core RTOS (KB)
RTOS kernel	—
Task stacks	≈ 2.6
Heap (RTOS objects)	5.19
IPC buffers	—
Total SRAM	≈ 7.8 KB
4.2 Heap Usage

Definition: Dynamic memory consumption behavior during runtime.

Metric	M4 Single-Core RTOS (KB)
Heap used	5.19
Minimum free heap	4.81

(5312 B used, 4928 B free)

4.3 Stack High Water Mark

Definition: Maximum stack usage observed per task (safety margin indicator).

Task	M4 Single-Core RTOS (bytes)
Signal Processing Task	728
Integration Task	1480
Parameter Computation Task	428
5. Application-Level Output Consistency Metrics
5.1 Spirometry Parameter Consistency

Definition: Consistency of computed physiological parameters on the M4 RTOS platform.

Parameter	M4 Single-Core RTOS
FEV₁ (L)	Measured
FVC (L)	Measured
PEF (L/s)	Measured
