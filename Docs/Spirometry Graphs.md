Spirometry results are mainly represented using **two standard graphs**: 

## 1️Volume–Time Curve - **X-axis:** 
Time (seconds) - **Y-axis:** Volume (litres) This curve shows how lung volume changes with time during a forced breathing maneuver. **Primary use:** Determine **time-based parameters**, especially **FEV₁**.
## 2️ Flow–Volume Loop - **X-axis:** Volume (litres) - **Y-axis:** 
Flow rate (litres/second) This loop represents airflow during **forced expiration and inspiration**. 

**Primary use:** **Pattern recognition** of lung diseases (obstructive vs restrictive). ---
