## Spirometry Parameters

![Parameters](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Lungvolumes_Updated.png)


###  1. FVC – Forced Vital Capacity

The **maximum volume of air** that can be forcibly exhaled after a full inhalation.

###  2. FVL – Flow-Volume Loop

A graphical representation of airflow versus lung volume during forced inspiration and expiration.

###  3. PEF – Peak Expiratory Flow

The **maximum flow rate** achieved during forced expiration.

**Units:** L/s or L/min
### 4. FEV₁ – Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second

The volume of air exhaled in the **first second** of forced expiration.

###  5. FEV₆ – Forced Expiratory Volume in 6 Seconds

Volume of air exhaled in the first **6 seconds** of forced expiration.

###  6. FEV₁ / FVC Ratio

The ratio of FEV₁ to FVC.

### 7. FEF₂₅–₇₅% – Forced Expiratory Flow (25–75%)

Average flow rate during the middle 50% of FVC.

###  8. SVC – Slow Vital Capacity

Maximum volume of air exhaled **slowly** after full inspiration (not forced).

###  9. MVV – Maximum Voluntary Ventilation

Maximum volume of air that can be inhaled and exhaled in **one minute** (usually measured over 12–15 seconds and extrapolated).
