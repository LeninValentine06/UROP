# Spirometer

A **spirometer** is a medical diagnostic device used to assess **pulmonary (lung) function** by measuring the volume of air a person can inhale and exhale, and the flow rate at which air moves through the airways.

The test performed using a spirometer is called **spirometry**.

## Clinical Applications

Spirometry is widely used for:
- Diagnosis of respiratory diseases such as **asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, and pulmonary fibrosis**
- Monitoring disease progression
- Evaluating response to treatment
- Pre-operative pulmonary assessment
